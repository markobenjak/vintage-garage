  "aboutUs": "We are the Vinković family - Tatjana, Robert, Ivan, and Lina. We started filling the Vintage Garage Vinković in 2009 with the long-desired Volkswagen T1 van from 1963. Since then, many different car models have passed through our garage until we selected the favorite ones that have stayed with us. We participated in numerous meetings with old-timers in Croatia and neighboring countries, which kept us together as a family. We have created friendships and acquaintances in the circles of old-timer fans, especially in the Volkswagen and Citroen scene, because these are the brands we are most attached to. We have decided to offer some models of those brands that adorn our garage today for future newlyweds and various other events.",
